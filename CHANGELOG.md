# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Dashboard
- **Five languages.** English, German, French, Spanish and Dutch, chosen from
  the browser's languages or the new selector. The non-English texts are
  machine-translated; corrections welcome. Knowledge-base texts and the
  receipt stay English.
- **Every domain, sortable and filterable.** A device's details list every
  domain it looked up, with company, category, lookups, blocks, first and
  last seen, and the rule's confidence and evidence links.
- **Export.** The report (CSV, one row per device, or JSON) and a device's
  domain table, generated in the browser.
- **Accessibility.** Arrow keys move between device cards; dialogs keep focus
  inside and return it on close; light-mode colours now meet WCAG AA
  contrast, checked by a test for light and dark.

## v0.2.0

### New
- **Since you fixed it.** Every report is compared with the period before it:
  snooping lookups a day before → now, the grade change, and which heartbeats
  stopped or started. It appears in the dashboard, `phonehome report` and a
  new *SINCE LAST WEEK* block on the receipt. See [docs/grading.md](docs/grading.md).
- **Home grade.** The home gets its own A–F grade: as good as its worst device.
- **Help classify.** `phonehome unknown` lists the domains the knowledge base
  can't explain yet, and each device's details have a *Suggest a rule* link
  that opens a prefilled GitHub issue with domain names only.
- **A friendlier first run.** Auto-detection says when it finds Pi-hole's or
  AdGuard Home's files but can't read them, and how to fix it. `serve` keeps
  looking until a source appears. The dashboard shows a setup panel instead of
  an empty page.
- **Setup guides** for Pi-hole (Docker, on the host, over its API), AdGuard
  Home, OpenWrt, Unraid, Synology and Proxmox, with compose files, plus
  Homebrew and AUR templates attached to each release.

### Knowledge base
- 540 → 715 rules and 114 → 138 companies. New coverage includes Windows,
  macOS/iOS, Linux, browsers, Microsoft 365, Slack, Zoom, messaging apps,
  game consoles, web trackers, Roborock US, Dreame and Google Home/Cast.
- 34 → 41 fixes: Panasonic, Sharp, Ecovacs, Blink, Tapo/Kasa (two) and Tuya.
  Six existing fixes were corrected against their sources.

### Reliability and speed
- Fuzz tests for every parser. They found and fixed: an AdGuard reader that
  could loop after a clock jump, a DHCP lease file broken by a device named
  `{`, and a `retention_days` overflow.
- Recovers from a replaced Pi-hole database, restarted ids and unreadable
  cursors. Reads dnsmasq 2.86+ answers that carry an extended DNS error.
- Retention also runs with `ingest --once`.
- Reports over 30 days are about twice as fast and use a third of the memory.
  `GOMEMLIMIT=128MiB` by default in the image and systemd unit. Numbers are in
  [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md).
